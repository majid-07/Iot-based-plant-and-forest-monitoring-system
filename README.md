# Iot-based-plant-and-forest-monitoring-system
The manual monitoring of the forest to prevent unauthorized activities is practically difficult job. The four major operations that are essential in monitoring the forest are developed in this work, namely tree cutting detection using vibration sensor, fire detection, temperature and humidity detection and water detection, fire sensor, water pump, smoke sensor, and soil sensor respectively. The sensed data from sensors is collected and sent to the authorized person via GSM. IOT is widely used technology in forest monitoring application
